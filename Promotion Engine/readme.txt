PROJECT:
IDENTIFICATION AND REMOVAL OF CRACKS IN DIGITAL IMAGES

PREREQUISITES:
TOOL USED : OpenCV
PLATFORM : Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

DESCRIPTION:
Many paintings, especially old ones, suffer from breaks in the substrate, the paint, or the varnish. 
These patterns are usually called cracks and can be caused by aging, drying, and mechanical factors. 
Age cracks can result from non-uniform contraction in the canvas or wood-panel support of the painting, 
which stresses the layers of the painting. 
Drying cracks are usually caused by the evaporation of volatile paint components and the consequent shrinkage of the paint. 
Finally, mechanical cracks result from painting deformations due to external causes, e.g. vibrations and impacts. 
The appearance of cracks on paintings deteriorates the perceived image quality. 
However, one can use digital image processing techniques to detect and eliminate the cracks on digitized paintings.
